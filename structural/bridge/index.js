//The Bridge pattern allows two components, a client and a service, to work together with each component having its own interface. Bridge is a high-level architectural pattern and its main goal is to write better code through two levels of abstraction. It facilitates very loose coupling of objects. It is sometimes referred to as a double Adapter pattern.

const { Gestures, Mouse, Screen, Audio } = require('./bridge');
const Log = require('../../log');

init();

function init() {

    var screen = new Screen();
    var audio = new Audio();

    var hand = new Gestures(screen);
    var mouse = new Mouse(audio);

    hand.tap();
    hand.swipe();
    hand.pinch();

    mouse.click();
    mouse.move();
    mouse.wheel();

    Log.show();
